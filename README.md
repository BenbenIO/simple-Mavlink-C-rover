# Simple Mavlink C++ example: Rover
<br>Mavlink (Micro Air Vehicle Link) is a protocol for unmanned vehicle (drone / rover). It is used to communicat with the mobile from the ground control station or compagnion computer. This repository aimes to provide an easy explanation on Mavlink, how to communicat with a Pixhawk and link useful ressources. </br>
<br>The proposed code is used to control a small rover equiped with Pixhawk2 from a compagnion computer (Raspberry3) in C++.</br>
<br>Finally, if your project can be done in python, I recommand using the [dronekit](http://python.dronekit.io/guide/quick_start.html) library, which is very complet and easy to use, you can still use the ressources to get a better understanding of mavlink protocol.</br>

<br>The first experience with Mavlink - Ardupiplot - Mission planner can be difficult but I hope this documents will help you. __If you see any mistake or want to help please feel free to push any change.__</br>
